## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

API- Application Programming Interface are mechanisms that enable two separate software component or sytems to communicate or interact using a set of rules and protocols. An API play a significant role in integration of existing software systems into a newly developed application. Therefore, facilitating innovation, high-performance, flexibility. E.g The popular transportation app Uber integrate Google map service in order to provide optimal services to it's users.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

An interface can be said to be a contract between two applications, that specifies how they communicate using requests and responses. 

API on the other hand is a type of interface that allows software applications to communicate with each other.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

The main components of an API are:
* API Client: This is responsible for assembling and directing API request.
* Request: This is a message sent to a server requesting an API to provide a service or information.
* Server: This is responsible for validating the input data and returning the appropriate response to the client,
* Response: These are responses provided by the server to the client after it has processed the request.
I find RESTful APIs intriguing and useful because they present a unique opportunity for businesses to meet their clients' needs across different platforms.


Types of APIs
* Private API's: These are used internally by an enterprise for connecting systems and data within the business.
* Public API's: They are open for use by the genenral public.
* Partner API's: They are strictly accessible to an authorized external developer to facilitate business partnerships
* composite API's: It combine multiple API's into one unified interface, to address complex system requirements.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

I used curls command line to interact with spotify.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

I feel confident with API exploration, but I need to experiment more to broaden my understanding.
